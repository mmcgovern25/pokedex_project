# Now that we already created our delicious Lasagna class, it's time to start cooking those lasagnas :P

# 1. Create 2 lasagnas. Choose your favorite flavors

# 2. How much time does it take in total to cook each of those lasagnas?

# 3. Let's pretend you put your lasagnas in the oven 10 minutes ago. How much time they should still remain in the oven, so they are properly cooked?
