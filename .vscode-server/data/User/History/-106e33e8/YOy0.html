  <h1>Pedro (calories) Soriano</h1>
<h2>Vancouver Enthusiast / Web Developer</h2>
  <p>
    I was born into this world with a <strong>THICK</strong> mustache. From a young age, I have alwaws been passionate about Cbums instagram page and counting my calories. <br />
    Every once in a while, I enjoy a nice morning stroll, as it allows me to eat more calories later in the day. <em>Canadians and baile funky are life.</em>
